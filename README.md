Spring 2016

In this project we programmed a two dimensional matrix that had the first element [0][0] as the poisioned crumb. The object the program would ask the user to take the first bite and who ever would eat the last bite lost as it poisoned. The computer and the user roate turns. The user would provide the column and the row of the cooke that he wanted to eat, and the eaten part of the matrix was removed and the remaining part would be displayed.
